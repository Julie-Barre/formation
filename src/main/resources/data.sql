He then explained to her that she was remembering things wrong, so he needed to retell her why he did what he did before she left Krypton. He started by explaining that the Phantom Zone was inhabited by some sort of ghostly life. These beings were angry about being removed from their home by the projector and took out their anger by possessing various people who lived on Krypton. Zor-El then discovered that the only way to destroy the phantoms was with Kryptonian Sunstone. He implanted sunstones into her to make her immune to possession by the Phantoms. Shortly afterward, the students at the school Kara went to on Krypton were possessed by these Phantoms and they were forced to kill them all with sunstone. For this, the Kryptonian Science Council had decided that Zor-El, Kara, and Alura should be sentenced to exile in the Phantom Zone. However the final quakes before Krypton''s destruction interrupted this before the sentence could be carried out. Then, in the present day, Kara found herself back on Earth and saw the Phantoms there.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/790.jpg');

As Logan tried to convince Idie to stay hidden Cyclops pressured her to act: leading to Idie killing a dozen men. Logan was enraged and blamed Cyclops. Eventually it got worse when Wolverine saw that the idea of Cyclops raising and training the teenage mutants as soldiers were only going to get them killed and after demolishing a Sentinel that was sent to destroy Utopia, Wolverine and a number of X-Men quit the team and left with a number of the teenage mutants to return to their former home in New York with it clear that Cyclops has clearly crossed the line with his actions.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/161.jpg');

Returning to reality, Thanos and the Infinity Watch were attacked by an assemblage of heroes before the true threat of the Magus could be revealed. Taking the fight to the Magus, Warlock reassembled the Infinity Gauntlet in order to match the combined might of the five Cosmic Cubes possessed by the Magus, although ultimately Magus would gain the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. During the battle, Thanos was pitted against his doppelganger, who had become the Magus'' most favored lackey, and in defeating it, gained insight into Magus'' schemes. Confronting him, Thanos pointed out that Magus didn''t, in fact, have the full power of the Infinity Gauntlet, as the Reality Gem was actually an elaborate fake. Rattled, the Magus was then thwarted by the embodiments of Eternity and Infinity, and the Infinity Gems were restored to their owners. Unknown to all, the Reality Gem was in fact held by Thanos himself, and had been since Warlock first distributed the Gems to the Infinity Watch.

After being lost in the timestream for a while, Brian briefly had precognitive flashes, though these eventually abated. For a time, all of his abilities were localized to Britain; if he went abroad for too long a time without wearing his costume, his powers eventually diminished to nothing. His costume acts as an antenna and battery, allowing him to retain his powers wherever he goes. When he and Meggan destroyed the Otherworld energy matrix at Roma''s prompting, however, the energies that allowed him to retain his power within the UK without his costume were dissipated. Hence, to retain his powers anywhere on Earth, he must wear the costume at all times. Recently, Brian has gained the ability to use his powers even without his suit. They are now based on his confidence. With greater confidence comes more power, and he weakens as his confidence does.\"},{\"powers\":\"Originally, his powers were linked to the Amulet of Right, worn around his neck, and he depended on a mace-like Star Scepter to fly. Later on Merlyn changed his costume just before he entered an alternate Earth (Earth-238), removing the Amulet and the Scepter placing the powers in his new costume. Not long after that he was killed by the Fury and had his body remade by Merlyn, who chose this point to make his powers innate and stronger, with his costume merely serving as a \"\"battery\"\" and amplifier. Currently, Brian''s powers are sustained by his own confidence and heritage as the son of a denizen of Otherworld. Thus, the more confident he is, the greater his powers are and vice versa.\"},{\"powers\":\"\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Strength\"},{\"powers\":\"While wearing his costume, Braddock''s strength is increased to high superhuman levels. At his peak, he''s able to lift approximately 90 tons.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Stamina\"},{\"powers\":\"Braddock''s advanced musculature produces considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a normal human. At his peak, he can exert himself physically for about 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Durability\"},{\"powers\":\"While wearing his costume, Braddock''s body is surrounded by an invisible force field that renders him highly resistant to physical injury. The field allows him to sustain powerful energy blasts, great impact forces such as bazooka shells or being repeatedly struck by superhumanly strong opponents, temperature extremes, and falls from great heights without being injured. However, repeated impacts from sufficiently powerful forces or weaponry will weaken and, eventually, penetrate the field. The field''s density, however, is specially designed to allow oxygen and light to pass through it. This force field is now sustained by his own confidence.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Agility\"},{\"powers\":\"Braddock''s agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Reflexes\"},{\"powers\":\"Braddock''s reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Senses\"},{\"powers\":\"Braddock can purposely draw upon the energies that give him his other powers to temporarily increase the efficiency of his senses, enhancing them to superhuman levels.

Magneto was shocked and angry to learn that Illyana had become a child again, to stop the demonic invasion, and Sunspot instigated a battle between the Inner Circle and the New Mutants, until Magneto trapped all of the New Mutants in a metal ball. Shaw accused Magneto of having lost all of the control the Hellfire Club petitioned his membership for and the two battled. Magneto stated that he joined the X-Men, led the New Mutants, and entered the Hellfire Club to build a foundation for control and peace among mutant kind. Magneto said that the teams were to be his army against the coming war between humans and mutants and the New Mutants heard it all.

Warren felt compelled to display his skill, by battling Tigra, and it was revealed that Moondragon was manipulating all of them, to strengthen the Avengers. After Moondragon reconsidered, Warren departed. While Warren and Candy were in his cabin style mansion, the couple was attacked, by Ghost Rider, and aided, by the Avengers, until Warren calmed his former teammate. After Tanya Anderssen, Dr. Karl Lykos'' girlfriend, asked him to check if Sauron was alive or not, Warren later found himself again in the Savage Land, aiding Spider-Man in battling the Savage Land Mutates, where Brainchild experimented on him. After Warren and Spider-Man are transformed, Dr. Lykos absorbed their mutant energy and was permanently transformed into Sauron. After Spider-Man left, Warren called the X-Men and they were captured, while Warren escaped. Seeking to rescue his friends, Warren and Ka-Zar entered Sauron''s citadel and Warren distracted Sauron, while Ka-Zar rescued the X-Men.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/838.jpg');

The Hulk took his family into space to stop Hiro-Kala before the planets collided, killing everyone on both.

He soon found out his second son was evil and cruel, and the only thing he understood was violence. Still, Hulk could not bring himself to kill his own flesh and blood, so Skaar sealed Hiro-Kala in a rock tomb, leaving him imprisoned on KÃ¯Â¿Â½ai for the foreseeable future.

Rusk developed a biological weapon he tested at Mount Rushmore, releasing a deadly spreading contagion \"red zone\" but was bested by Captain America and the Avengers. Desiring the Skull''s Cosmic Cube for himself, former Soviet general Aleksander Lukin hired Rogers'' former WWII sidekick, Bucky (now known as the Winter Soldier) to assassinate the Skull. When the Skull was shot, he attempted to use the Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive, but the cube was weak. The transfer was only partially successful as the Skull only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin''s body; now the minds of the two enemies were trapped together in the same body. The Skull/Lukin formed numerous alliances with other villains, including Doctor Faustus, Doctor Doom, Arnim Zola and the Serpent Squad. The Skull used hypnotist Dr. Faustus to help arrange Captain America''s assassination. Under Faustus'' influence, former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and Cap''s occasional girlfriend Sharon Carter was brainwashed into killing Captain America herself. Freed from his ever-present nemesis, the Red Skull/Lukin raised a private army while attempting to arrange for Senator Gordon Wright to become president of the USA. The Winter Soldier became the new Captain America and overcame their plans. Arnim Zola transferred the Red Skull''s mind out of Lukin''s body and into one of his own spare android forms as a temporary measure. Shortly afterward, Lukin was killed by Sharon Carter and Zola was seemingly destroyed. The Red Skull remains trapped in Zola''s spare body.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/1392.jpg');

He attended Pennsylvania State University on a football scholarship, where he met Robert Bruce Banner and became interested in gamma ray research. After graduating, Walter pursued his research independently while accepting a position with a professional football team, the Green Bay Packers, and married Veronica, an actress who bore him a son. After earning over a million dollars, Walter retired and returned to school, soon earning his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Walter began teaching at McGill University in Montreal and furthered his gamma ray research, including studying BannerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous transformation into the Hulk, and Veronica soon divorced him, taking their son. At a new position with the Canadian governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Department H, Walter worked with James Hudson, whose plans for a new super-hero team would eventually lead to Alpha Flight. Langkowski acted as technical and scientific support for AlphaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s precursor, the Flight, which included Smart Alec, a brilliant man with access to vast amounts of information, Snowbird, a goddess with the power to change to any Arctic animal, and Wolverine, a vicious mutant with a mysterious past. Eventually, Langkowski exposed himself to gamma rays, hoping to gain powers like BannerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Instead he opened a mystic barrier that allowed the Great Beast Tanaraq to pass through, and Walter assumed its form, wrongly believing his powers came from the gamma radiation. At first, LangkowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brain and personality remained in control of his monstrous Sasquatch form, and he joined Alpha Flight himself. \n\nAlpha FlightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roster would change frequently over the years as they went through phases of government contracts and independent action. Walter studied many incoming operatives, who were generally assigned to training teams Beta and Gamma Flight, for Department H. One operative, later known as Wild Child, had a very unstable genotype and psychosis, but the government shoe-horned him into the program anyway. Langkowski buried Wild ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unstable results, figuring he would handle them at another time, though he never put much thought into it. In Alpha FlightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest missions, Sasquatch battled the X-Men, the Hulk, Sunset Bain, Machine Man, Tundra of the Great Beasts, Ranark the Ravager and Wendigo. Sasquatch also participated in the \"Contest of Champions\" organized by the Grandmaster and Death, and, as one of the GrandmasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operatives, battled the Chinese Collective Man to a stalemate. Langkowski was consulted by the Fantastic Four for his radiation expertise, and battled the Dire Wraiths, Omega Flight (in a battle where Hudson was believed killed) and the Collector. \n\nBecoming fast friends with the diminutive Puck, Walter started a romantic relationship with the light-powered Aurora, a fact her twin Northstar resented immensely. Walter and AuroraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship became complicated when Aurora began struggling with split personalities, one that liked Walter and one that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. In the process of trying to help Aurora retain her more outgoing personality, Walter altered her mutant powers. Sasquatch discovered his ability to quickly heal from injuries after he broke his arm in a battle with the Super-Skrull.Langkowski eventually began struggling with a more bestial side of his nature during various battles, and feared he was becoming more like the Hulk. When his aunt, Lillian Von Loont, left Walter a mansion on Tamarind Island, Walter and Aurora investigated only to battle Loont, who had become the cyborg madwoman Gilded Lily. This mansion would later serve as Alpha FlightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headquarters for a time. Sasquatch, alongside Alpha Flight and the X-Men, was temporarily cured of his rages by a Loki-possessed Madelyne Pryor. \n\nSnowbird, whose mission it was to slay the ancient Great Beasts who had roamed the Earth before mankind, discovered that WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sasquatch form was actually Tanaraq, and Walter was now losing control. Left with no choice, Snowbird followed Alpha FlightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battle with Caliber and slew Sasquatch by ripping out TanaraqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart. Alpha Flight pursued WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul into the realm of the Great Beasts and battled their leader, Somon who killed Aurora, Northstar and Talisman before Langkowski used his life-force to resurrect them. Shaman helped preserve WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul as they transported back to Earth, only to discover that WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body had been destroyed completely. WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul took over the Roger Bochs created Box armor as a temporary home and continued aiding Alpha Flight. Seeking a physical body, Walter entered the interdimensional Crossroads and briefly possessed the Hulk, but his soul was left adrift when he refused to displace his old friend Bruce BannerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirit. Months later, Walter found Omega FlightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now-mindless Smart Alec in the Crossroads, possessed him, and returned to Earth. \n\nDuring his absence, Snowbird had been killed, and the evil Pestilence had reanimated her albino Sasquatch form and attacked Alpha. Walter inhabited the Box armor again and aided his team, who were shocked to find him alive. At the battleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, Smart AlecÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s form had been crushed and the Sasquatch form left empty, so Walter transferred his soul to the Sasquatch form; however, when he returned the Sasquatch body to human state, he found himself in a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s form. Deciding to call himself Wanda, Langkowski rejoined the team, possessing none of SnowbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powers except the ability to transform into the Sasquatch. Aurora was distressed at LangkowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return as a woman and attempted to get the flesh-altering Lionel Jeffries to alter WandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s form to a man again, but this failed due to WandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body having SnowbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s godly attributes. Wanda struggled to adjust to her new form, and, after batting Bedlam, was overcome by a mysterious force and helped resurrect four of the Great Beasts. Overcoming the temptation to join them, Sasquatch helped Alpha Flight banish the Beasts back to their realm. After brief jaunts through space and Dream QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dimension, Wanda sought to reclaim LangkowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fortune to help fund Alpha Flight, but the fortune had been willed to Veronica; unable to prove she was Walter, Wanda left the fortune in VeronicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands. In final battle with the Dream Queen, Sasquatch was bewitched to be loyal to the villain until SnowbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirit freed Sasquatch from the spell and changed WandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s form back into WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s; this also changed the albino Sasquatch form back into the orange one, and enabled Walter to reclaim his fortune. \n\nThe team battled Llan the Sorcerer, a villain who briefly broke both of SasquatchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arms (though the injury soon healed). When Alpha Flight restructured itself, Sasquatch was assigned to both Alpha Flight and Gamma Flight, in the latter as Biotech research and development. When Wild Child joined the team as Weapon Omega, Walter struggled with guilt over his part in Wild ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins and the truth soon came out, causing several team members to distrust Sasquatch. Alpha Flight continued to act as super-heroes despite breaking ties with the Canadian government over the newly instituted Super Powers Act. Struggling with all he had lost over the years by devoting all his time to Alpha Flight, Sasquatch was easily drawn into following the mystical Goddess, the \"good\" side of Adam WarlockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul, who controlled Sasquatch and others into battling fellow heroes for her cause. Remembering his doubts regarding religion, Sasquatch shook off the GoddessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence with ShamanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help, and the Goddess was soon defeated. \n\nThough Alpha Flight soon disbanded, Walter continued his gamma ray research at Project Michelangelo in Antarctica. Months later, the mercenary Deadpool attacked the base and caused the core to overload, endangering the entire world, so Sasquatch and Deadpool teamed up to shut it down. The Canadian government, in forming a new Alpha Flight, discovered a true bestial Sasquatch in the woods and assumed it was Walter. Finding ways to subdue the beast, they had this Sasquatch participate in team missions until it was killed while battling EclipticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Zodiac, and the team held a funeral for Walter. Still in Antarctica and unaware of the new team, Walter discovered corruption in the Canadian government. Sasquatch helped gather some of the original team and the group exposed the corrupt government program, then stayed on to rejoin Alpha Flight. While aiding Wolverine (actually a Skrull imposter)in a battle against A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), Alpha Flight was shocked to find Snowbird alive again. Walter and Aurora became romantically involved once more, but Aurora was soon terrorized by Mauvais and kidnapped by the corrupt Weapon X program, leaving no trace of her whereabouts. When Alpha Flight went up against the X-Men again, Sasquatch briefly donned battle armor that allowed him to defeat a weakened Juggernaut. \n\nWhen all of his teammates were captured by the alien Plodex, Sasquatch recruited new heroes, formed a new Alpha Flight and rescued his former teammates. The former Alpha Flight members left for space, leaving SasquatchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team to take their place, move into the Plodex base, and sever ties with the Canadian government once again. Alpha Flight embarked on a complicated time travel adventure before the original Alpha Flight members returned and rejoined the team. After speaking at NorthstarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral and battling Sabretooth and Wendigo, Sasquatch briefly participated in S.H.I.E.L.D.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Howling Commandos team. He later accompanied Alpha Flight in investigating the powerful mutant Collective, but they swiftly fell before his assault. His teammates Guardian, Major Mapleleaf, both Pucks, Vindicator, and Shaman, were all apparently killed and Alpha Flight was disbanded in the wake of the tragedy. However, a new team was quickly assembled by CSIS to replace them, this time called Omega Flight. Sasquatch was selected to serve','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/863.jpg');

She can snap the length of it through the air like a whip (the tip of which moves faster than the speed of sound), or rotate it in a fan-like manner. She can bind persons or objects with it as if it were rope or use it to lift objects which weigh more than she could lift with her arms.

Her hair, approximately 6 feet in length while relaxed, can elongate to almost twice its normal length with only about a 25% loss of overall tensile strength. One strand of hair, 2-feet long, can support 6.4 pounds, a list-sized lock of hair can support about 750 pounds and her whole head of hair can lift about 3,200 pounds (1.6 tons). A portion of her hair must be used to anchor the rest at these greater weights, so that more than her scalp/skull is used as a brace.\"},{\"powers\":\"As yet Medusa has not manifested her psychokinetic powers in any way except the animation of her own hair.

Said ritual involved the creation of a new life, and though Piotr was initially reluctant, the two women persisted until he surrendered himself to their affections. Later, the X-Men were captured by the assassin Arcade, who brainwashed Colossus into believing he was the Proletarian, workers'' hero of communist Russia, and turned him against his teammates. Colossus overcame this conditioning, and the X-Men soon faced the reality-manipulating mutant Proteus, who proved to be vulnerable to metal. Seizing upon this weakness, Colossus plunged his metal fists into the heart of Proteus'' energy form, seemingly destroying him and taking Colossus'' innocence along with him. Soon after, the X-Men recruited young mutant Kitty Pryde. Despite their initial shyness, a romance blossomed between her and Colossus. Later, Arcade''s assistant Miss Locke kidnapped the X-Men''s loved ones, including Illyana, to coerce the team into rescuing Arcade from the despotic Doctor Doom. The X-Men rescued them, and Illyana remained with her brother at Xavier''s mansion. Eventually, Illyana was trapped in the demon-filled realm Limbo by its then-master, Belasco. She remained his captive for many years, though only moments had elapsed on Earth, and returned as the adolescent sorceress Magik.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/48.jpg');

There, a psychiatrist named Dr. Primrose seemingly helped Buffy realise that her \"delusions\" about being the Slayer were actually fantasies she had invented to help her overcome the normal problems that teenagers face; vampires and demons were merely metaphors for growing up. Buffy accepted this, only to discover that the clinic was in fact home to the demon Rakagore, who, under the identity of \"Dr. Stone\", was using the clinic''s patients to do his evil bidding. Buffy defeated Rakagore and learned that Dr. Primrose was a former Watcher.

As Zhang Tong, the Mandarin, still driven by a need for conquest, became a criminal overlord in Hong Kong, allowing ten underlings to use his rings as his operatives in the so-called Hand.

Green Arrow has shown the ability to shoot an arrow down the barrel of a gun, pierce a drop of water as it leaves a tap, and shoot almost any part of the human body; although he aims only to wound and not kill when he shoots. He once shot two arrows down two different gun barrels while upside down, in mid-flip while somersaulting off a building.\"},{\"powers\":\"Aviation\"},{\"powers\":\"He used to own and fly his own airplane called the Arrowplane.

His only hope to return to earth was by impregnating women because his children are linked to his dimension. About twenty years ago, Azazel began mating with women who had strange appearances, at least with looks and abilities other women didn''t have. He met Mystique in Germany, when she was married to a rich castle lord named Baron Christian Wagner. With Christian unable to give her children, Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner. Mystique had secretly been taking lovers to produce an heir to Count Wagner. Mystique fell in love with him, and although she was hesitant to betray Christian as she still loved him, she gave in to Azazel and they made love. Not much later, Mystique was pregnant with Nightcrawler. Soon afterward, she killed Christian because he suspected her betrayal. She had gone looking for him but he was nowhere to be found. It is later known that Azazel was taking care of business involving the Cheyarafim, and had to leave knowing that Mystique would find some way to live. However, she didn''t have much time to formulate a plan, as the angry villagers soon found out about Christian''s murder and came after her and the demonic looking baby. In order to save her own life, she shape-shifted into one of the villagers and dropped Nightcrawler over the cliff, saying she pushed the woman off too. With her own life saved, she ran away. Mystique was the only woman that Azazel sought to have relations with besides simply procreation.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/1481.jpg');

During his first appearance his strength overwhelmed that of Goku during several moments in their battle and nearly killed him however as time passed Goku surpassed his strength however Vegeta has equaled and passed Goku''s strength several times. Without using his chi-boosting ability, Vegeta''s strength baseline is very close to Goku''s allowing him to lift/press 100 to 150 tons with minimal effort. In his SuperSayin 1 form, Vegeta is at least capable of lifting/pressing at least 7500 tons. At the end of Dragon Ball GT, Vegeta like Goku achieves the final Super Saiyan form the Super Saiyan 4 and is well matched to Goku in terms of power. Vegeta can lift over 145,000 tons ,and the upper limits of his strength capacity are unknown.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Speed\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta''s Saiyan body grants him superhuman speed greater than that of any human in the universe. He moves and reacts at superhuman speed and as has been shown to move excessively faster than cars and is capable of moving well over many times the speed of sound, and arguably surpassing light speed as he is shown to routinely dodge ki beams which have previously been clocked at or beyond the speed of light.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Durability\"},{\"powers\":\"Like all Saiyans, Vegeta''s body is superhumanly durable however has been shown to not be as durable as Goku from time to time however at the end of Dragon Ball GT it is highly likely that he had become physically as durable as Goku. Vegeta can withstand high caliber bullets, powerful explosions and destructive energy blasts without sustaining damage and has several feats of durability such as withstanding energy blasts capable of destroying entire cities, and easily surpassing the durability of Frieza, who survived the planet Namek''s explosion while already half dead. In the anime and manga, Vegeta is shown to be capable of taking quite a beating; referencing his fights with Frieza and Kid Buu. In the anime Vegeta is seen withstanding the destruction of several planets at once by his father, when he was still a small child. Vegeta is also capable of withstanding heavy blows from very powerful enemies such as Super Buu, Omega Shenron, Super 17 and more. Vegeta was also shown as the most durable of the posse that was present with him when facing Super 17 and the most difficult to deal with with the exception of Goku.\"},{\"powers\":\"Energy Manipulation\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta has complete mastery over his energy manipulation and can use it for things such as energy blasts, energy waves, energy balls, energy spheres, energy shields and more. Vegeta is able to create colossal energy blasts powerful enough to easily destroy entire planets without using his full power, his favorite blasts throughout the series and his most powerful ones are Galick Gun, Final Flash and Final Shine Attack. It is noted during his battle with Android 18 that he has the ability to destroy the planet if serious, and is again noted that during Vegeta''s battle with Perfect Cell when he launched a very powerful Final Flash that the Earth would have been destroyed on impact if he had not condensed the beam at the final second. Even during his first encounter with Goku he attempted to destroy the Earth with his Galick Gun attack but his attack was countered with Goku''s Kamehameha blast and that could hint that Vegeta has destroyed planets before with single energy blasts. In the anime Vegeta easily destroys the planet Arlia with a casual blast from his fingertips. Aside from energy blasts Vegeta can create large energy balls his most powerful being The Big Bang Attack which he used to destroy Android 19 during his battle with him when he was a Super Saiyan. Vegeta can manipulate different types of energy the most common being ki for it is highly likely that before Vegeta arrived on Earth he did not how to sense and change ki at will. Vegeta can use the energy around him to enhance or and increase his power(including physical attributes) he does this by gathering the energy in his environment and a sign that the energy is being gathered is when a flame-like aura is formed around his body and when he increases his energy by gathering more energy when the aura is around him it begins to flicker as the energy begins to shift further increasing his power. He can also channel the energy through his body to increase his physical strength and can concentrate ki or any energy into single areas of his body such as fists to use energy enhanced strikes as spheres of dense energy form around his fists. Vegeta can also sense the energy of other beings and can use this ability to follow their energy signatures and locate the beings.\"},{\"powers\":\"Telepathy\"},{\"powers\":\"Naturally like all Saiyans, Vegeta has the natural mental ability of telepathy. Vegeta can use his telepathy to communicate with other beings however he is unable to launch mental attacks or protect his mind using mental abilities.\"},{\"powers\":\"Teleportation\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta can seemingly teleport several distances as he is seen suddenly appearing behind enemies by reappearance however this is probably an after image technique coupled with extreme super speed rather than truly teleportation, as it is never hinted that Vegeta know the Instant Transmission (Shunkan Ido) Technique.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Stamina\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta''s Saiyan physiology produces less fatigue poisons than any human and he can engage in intense physical activity for weeks before the production of fatigue toxins begin to impale his blood and body. His stamina is further increased by his intense training.\"},{\"powers\":\"Superhuman Agility\"},{\"powers\":\"His body grants him superhuman agility, greater bodily coordination and balance than any human in the universe and he is able to engage in complicated and humanly impossible physical acrobatic movements and his agility allows him to dodge and evade light speed fast attacks.\"},{\"powers\":\"Flight\"},{\"powers\":\"Like all Saiyans, Vegeta is able to engage in flight and has complete mastery over it as he is able to perfectly levitate, hover, spin swiftly while maintaining the same altitude and balance and can easily dodge fast projectiles while airborne. Vegeta flies incredibly fast and can fly at high atmospheric pressures and intense and harsh temperatures and environments. In the anime only Garlic Junior Saga he is even seen flying between nearby planets.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Eating\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta like all Saiyans has the natural ability of super eating. Vegeta consumes enormous amounts of food however this is rather out of sustenance and the need to replenish his energy rather than sheer lust for food however there has been on one occasion where he gets into a fight against Goku because each one claims the other stole the other''s food and this could be out of pure love of food.\"},{\"powers\":\"Unarmed Combat\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta is a master of hand to hand combat and is an extremely smart and intelligent fighter finding out his enemies weaknesses and using them to his advantage. Vegeta normally observes his opponent''s fighting style and rapidly creates counters for virtually every maneuver he witnesses, he is a master of many hand to hand fight styles as he was an elite Saiyan warrior and is a master martial artist on Earth and has even overwhelmed Goku in all of their battles with his skill and dexterity proving that his skills is more than enough for Goku to handle. He is arguably the smartest fighter in all of DBZ (Piccolo being the wisest and most careful) and he is functionally a better fighter than Goku in terms of pure skill.\"},{\"powers\":\"Ki Awareness\"},{\"powers\":\"Can sense others who have significant power and their locations. He can also raise and lower his ki to hide his location from others.\"},{\"powers\":\"Zanzoken\"},{\"powers\":\"When the person moves at great speeds to create after images of themselves.\"},{\"powers\":\"Ki Blast\"},{\"powers\":\"Just an energy blast, can fire it in the form of a ball or a wave.\"},{\"powers\":\"Renzoku energy dan\"},{\"powers\":\"Multiple Ki blast shot like a machinegun\"},{\"powers\":\"Kienzan\"},{\"powers\":\"A disc of energy that can cut through almost anything. If someone is significantly stronger they can catch it if they prepare themselves\"},{\"powers\":\"Fusion Dance\"},{\"powers\":\"If another person knows the fusion dance and has relatively the same power Vegeta can fuse with them to create one person for 20 - 30 minutes at a time.\"},{\"powers\":\"Fireball\"},{\"powers\":\"Used against Goku in their first battle\"},{\"powers\":\"Barrier\"},{\"powers\":\"Creates a barrier of energy\"},{\"powers\":\"Mouth Blast\"},{\"powers\":\"Shoots an energy blast from mouth (used in Oozaru form)\"},{\"powers\":\"Energy Rings\"},{\"powers\":\"Rings of energy that restrains a person to a structure.\"},{\"powers\":\"Zenkai Power\"},{\"powers\":\"A Saiyajin ability that allows him to become stronger after every battle and near death experience.\"},{\"powers\":\"Bakuhatsuha\"},{\"powers\":\"Creates a ball of energy surrounding himself destroying everything in the nearby area\"},{\"powers\":\"Garic Hou (Galick Gun)\"},{\"powers\":\"One of Vegeta''s signature attacks, an energy wave similar to Goku''s Kamehameha. It is powerful enough to destroy entire planets if needed.\"},{\"powers\":\"Big Bang Attack\"},{\"powers\":\"A devastating ball of energy that is fired from one hand. The resulting blast causes a massive explosion and usually leaves a mushroom cloud afterwards. This attack often regarded as Vegeta''s most powerful move, and most of the time is used as his strongest attack in video games.\"},{\"powers\":\"Atomic Blast\"},{\"powers\":\"A one handed energy blast that was used to blow a hole right through Majin Buu\"},{\"powers\":\"Final Shine\"},{\"powers\":\"A one handed energy blast usually green in color\"},{\"powers\":\"Final Flash\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta''s second most powerful attack that fires a powerful beam using both palms together\"},{\"powers\":\"Final Explosion\"},{\"powers\":\"An extremely powerful suicide attack. Creates an immense ball of energy surrounding Vegeta and obliterates anything nearby.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Saiyan-jin\"},{\"powers\":\"Hair and aura turns yellowish gold and all attributes are greatly increased. In this form, Vegeta''s base power is multiplied by 50 giving him a colossal power increase.\"},{\"powers\":\"Ultra Super Saiyan-jin 1st stage\"},{\"powers\":\"Muscles, strength and power increase greatly. In his Ascended Super Saiyan form, Vegeta was capable of overpowering the newly formed Semi-Perfect Cell\"},{\"powers\":\"Ultra Super Saiyan-jin 2nd stage\"},{\"powers\":\"Mass and strength increase greatly but speed is decreased. Vegeta is never shown to have this form, but he is well aware of its strength and is assumed to be fully capable of becoming it. He doesn''t because of its extreme speed decrease hampering his battle prowess.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Saiyajin full power\"},{\"powers\":\"Rage and concentration is no longer required to maintain the super saiyan state. It looks the same as regular super saiyan but is a tad bit stronger and can conserve energy more effectively.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Saiyan-jin 2\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta''s already immense power is multiplied by 2 for a 100x power increase. However he has trained endlessly to enhance the power increase in this form. He is immensely strong and is shown to be STRONGER than Goku''s Super Saiyan 3 in this form after the Battle of the Gods movie. Bills was able to stop Super Saiyan 3 Goku with a finger, but when Bills slaps bulma, Vegeta is able to give Bills a good beating until he gets serious.\"},{\"powers\":\"Revenge Deathball\"},{\"powers\":\"A spirit bomb created of evil dark energy and is charged up much faster than Goku''s. Vegeta only uses this technique when he is possessed by Baby.\"},{\"powers\":\"Ozaru\"},{\"powers\":\"When Vegeta has his tail and saw the full moon he can turn into the great ape. This form multiplies Vegeta''s powers 10x. This form was also attained when Bulma used the Blutz wave on Vegeta.\"},{\"powers\":\"Golden Ozaru\"},{\"powers\":\"Basically Ozaru in Super Saiyan-jin form.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Saiyan-jin 3\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta never reaches this form in the series. Although he is strong enough he is either unable or unwilling to transform into this state. Perhaps it is because he saw Goku use his Super Saiyajin 3 power up technique to kill Kid Buu but lost his power when charging up. Vegeta called the technique stupid.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Saiyan-Jin Blue\"},{\"powers\":\"Vegeta''s most powerful form to date. This transformation gives Vegeta a divine ki and his hair and aura turn into a pale blue color. The power of this form is so great, that Wiss himself stated that if Goku and Vegeta worked together and fought Beerus while at this state, they would have a very decent chance to beat him.\"},{\"powers\":\"Super Saiyan-jin 4\"},{\"powers\":\"Reddish brown fur covers the body and hair grows a little. This form is first reached by controlling the Golden Ozaru form.\"}]','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/1206.jpg');

Originally of AulÃƒÂ«''s people, he acquired great \"\"scientific\"\" knowledge of the world''s substances and how to use them. He would retain this knowledge throughout his tenure as the Dark Lord in Middle-earth, using it to forge the One Ring and construct his fortress of Barad-dÃƒÂ»r. Sauron also seemed primarily linked to the use of fire, and as Morgoth''s chief lieutenant, his ability to tap into the fires in the earth was of great value.\"},{\"powers\":\"Among Sauron''s chief powers were deception and disguise: In the First Age Sauron took on many forms. His battle against Luthien and Huan in The Silmarillion has him taking on no less than four separate shapes: his \"\"normal\"\" shape, presumed to be that of some kind of terrible dark sorcerer, a great wolf, a serpent, and finally a vampire \"\"dripping blood from his throat upon the trees\"\" (\"\"Of Beren and LÃƒÂºthien,\"\" The Silmarillion). At the end of the First Age, Sauron took on a fair form to appeal to the Captain of the Hosts of the Valar and ask for pardon. In the Second Age, Sauron took up that fair form again and used it under the alias \"\"Annatar\"\" to deceive the Elves into creating the Rings of Power. The level of deception required to fool the Elves of Eregion must have gone beyond simply taking on a fair form. Sauron was literally instructing the Elves to make artifacts that while capable of great good, were ultimately purposed for his own domination and were imbued with power to arrest the natural order of the world. The Elves were unaware of who they were dealing with until the eleventh hour, and only narrowly escaped his trap. Centuries later, Sauron was able to deceive the NÃƒÂºmenÃƒÂ³reans and steer them directly to their own destruction under promises of eternal life. Such destruction is a testament to Sauron''s manipulative nature and ability to twist the perceptions of his enemies.\"},{\"powers\":\"An interesting dichotomy is set up between his deceptive nature and his symbol. While rarely appearing personally and deceiving all but the most wary, he represented himself as an all seeing eye that could pierce all disguises. Consistent with Tolkien''s theme of evil being finite, wasteful, and self-destructive, Sauron''s powers gradually decreased as time went on. After the Fall of NÃƒÂºmenor he was incapable of taking physical form for many years, and then later became a horrific Dark Lord. After losing the Ring it took even longer for him to regain physical form, although by the War of the Ring he had regained it.\"},{\"powers\":\"The extent, nature, and specifics of Sauron''s power are largely left to the imagination.

The chain was given to him by his Earth father Professor Broom which always reminds Hellboy that he makes himself be who he wants to be and that he is good. He also makes use of a Smith Wesson M29, but only very rarely.\n\nThe Good Samaritan\nThe Good Samaritan was given to Hellboy by his friend, the Torch of Liberty. The gun was made in Massachusetts. It''s made up of different metals like silver, metal from old horseshoes, cannonballs, and melted metals from sacred amulets. Upon melting the the sacred amulets, incantations were said. Even the handle of the gun was made from a portion of the True Cross. Hellboy called the gun The Good Samaritan because he would put monsters out of their misery. The Good Samaritan is like a miniature hand cannon. It weighs 6lbs which could also be used as a hammer. It is a .20 mm mega-pistol that can blow huge holes in buildings. The gun can hold up to four bullets making it the ultimate weapon. Upon impact a glass chamber within the bullet casing launches numerous things. These things can include holy water, white oak or anything else thats needed to be used to defeat the monster at hand. In the side of the gun, Hellboy embedded a B.R.P.D symbol and after Professor Broom had given Hellboy the double-faced medallion, Hellboy split the medallion in half and placed a face of it on both side of the gun handle.\n\nThe Right Hand of Doom\nAnother weapon is The Right Hand of Doom (his large rock like arm). The hand is virtually indestructible and as such Hellboy often uses it as a method for defense as well as offense. It is said to be the key to Armageddon. The hand has shown mystical capabilities such as being able to hurt the hero Ghost. The full extent of its powers are yet to be seen, but it is implied that it holds tremendous power. The hand is not without its disadvantages however as Hellboy can''t use The Good Samaritan in his right hand.

When his uncle was besieged by attackers in the building, Phil hid and tried to find help. Stumbling upon an experimental new Green Goblin costume Phil also fell into a chamber of the Goblin Formula. \n\nQuickly dressing up in the suit, he scared off the hoods. Later on, he decided that the costume and equipment were worth using. \n\nAfter his discovery of the Goblin arsenal and equipment, Phil ran into the Scarlet Spider, Rhino, the Hobgoblin, Joystick and others. Many were unsure of his purpose and motives as they were also curious about this new Goblin on the scene. \n\nIt was not until a corrupt judge targeted Ben and sent the assassin Purge to kill him that Phil decided to take on his new persona with responsibility. Teaming up with Daredevil the pair were able to stop Purge. \n\nThis act gave the new hero a lot of attention and he developed a small but devoted following. Liz Allan asked Ben for information on who was using her husband''s former identity. She later gave Phil her \"blessing\" after he saved her and her son Normie from Angelface. \n\nDuring Onslaught''s attack, the Goblin costume was heavily damaged after battling Sentinels. Phil soon decided to retire as an active hero. \n\nHe has recently been seen as part of Excelsior.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/75.jpg');

Depending on the combat situation they are being deployed into the equipment carried by a Spartan changes. However they have some all purpose weapons and euipment. \n\nEvery Spartan wears at least the MJOLNIR Mark V and several have the Mark VI model which have thermal optic and infrared vision modes. Cameras are also planted in the Spartan''s helmet as it is standard procedure to record all missions for future review. Weapons are carried through the use of magnetic adhesive strips in specific locations such as the back and thighs, allowing Spartans to carry both human and covenant technology or even tactical HAVOK nukes for demolition work. Their armour also has the capability to carry an AI construct, such as Cortana. They are used to provide tactical guidance, provide objectives, hack into enemy communications channels and devices, analyze data, weapons, machines and identify specific threats. A flash light in the side of the helmet that runs off a recharging fusion power pack in the back of the armor is also included. Also, the visor of a Spartan provides a real time HUD (heads up display) and can provide weapon info, ammunition used and remaining, health and pulse monitors, energy shield status, active motion tracker and way points laid down by an AI. The MJOLNIR Mark VI has its own supply of biofoam and when a Spartan is wounded it is automatically administered. This foam stops blood loss and can temporarily replace muscle tissue, allowing the Spartan to continue to function even when wounded.\n\nThe most important piece of equipment for a Spartan is his or her MJOLNIR armor, a full-body suit with a reflective visor. The armor consists of green ceramic outer plates with metallic inner plating. The suit augments neural ability, with slight commands becoming big motions with big results. It also allows for an AI to interface with the suit, acting as a layer between the suit and the brain. An AI interfacing with the suit provides improved response time, among other things. The first version of this armor put into use was the MJOLNIR Mark IV, which Dr. Halsey tasked John''s team to retrieve. This entry-level version was rather primitive compared to newer incarnations, and because of conditions on Reach, spare parts were not available. Just before the Master Chief was deployed to Halo Installation 04, all available Spartans on Reach upgraded to the Mark V, which added an automatically-recharging energy shield to protect the wearer from initial damage. On his return from the original Halo the Chief was equipped with a new permutation of the amour. This latest armor is even more powerful, with a slightly more resilient shield, off-hand coordination enhancements that allow the wearer to wield two small weapons accurately, ammunition and heat tracking for the second weapon, and enhanced zoom capabilities using the helmet''s visor. The suit was originally designed for use by unaugmented humans. Tests of this suit showed that the neural interface that allows the suit to move at a thought was too fast for an average human soldier, which proved fatal for the personnel inside. When given to the Spartans it proved to be manageable. The suit''s codename MJOLNIR attests to this fact; in Norse mythology, Thor''s hammer Mjolnir was too heavy to be carried by any but the strongest of body and mind. The Spartans quickly adapted to the suit and it is now an important addition to their arsenal.\"}]','[{\"weapons\":\"The origional Spartans mainly used the MA5B, MA2B (a shortened version of the MA5B with an attachable silencer), M6D magnum and fiber optic cables.\n\nThe Master Chief also has another weapon that only he has, Cortana, the A.I. Cortana can do various things from cracking lock codes to holding vast amounts of knowledge or just telling the Chief when targets are approaching. While not mandatory it gives John the upperhand against opponents.She can also perform many tasks that she was not intended to perform. Because of her high tech programing, she can also access the Covenant Battle-Net, pilot many ships made by alien hands, and fire the Halos using an index.\"}]','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/1110.jpg');

Since XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an had come back from Saigon with visions of peace between human and mutantkind, Junkpile felt that he had strayed from his destiny. Junkpile believed that mutants were born with the power to do what they wanted, and to try to work for peace with weaker humans would degrade them. So that when the Synge Corporation thought XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an had murdered their founder, Noah Synge, Junkpile gave them enough information to raid XiÃ¯Â¿Â½anÃ¯Â¿Â½s gathering and kill him. But the assassination failed, and Junkpile was forced to fight his ex-teammates and kidnap an injured XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an. As Junkpile had installed a psionic jammer that kept Cerebra out of his head, Serpentina wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t strong enough to hurt him, and Timothy Fitzgerald couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t use his powers properly, taking XiÃ¯Â¿Â½anÃ¯Â¿Â½s body was easy. After returning to the Synge Corporations headquarters with XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an, Junkpile later stopped Krystalin from killing the corporationÃ¯Â¿Â½s new head, Lytton Synge, and then fought the X-Men that had come to save XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an and clear his name. Serpentina attacked him impulsively, and he killed her by shoving her face against the wall, which galvanized the rest of the X-Men to attack him. But none of them were strong enough to hurt him until XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an appeared revived and used the disintegrating power of his left hand to disable Junkpile. And though Junkpile threatened that if XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t kill him, he would come after him, XiÃ¯Â¿Â½an believed he would eventually see his mistake and return as a friend, and so let him live.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/10002.jpg');

It is, however, entirely possible that Godzilla never used his atomic breath at its full power, seeing as how Godzilla was already extremely weak when he began using it, while the film''s official novelization and an earlier screenplay suggest that the female M.U.T.O.''s EMP field interferes with his atomic breath, so whether or not it''s capable of more is unknown at this point.

Ice cold calculation wrapped with a passion for violence. All driven by the organic heart of a murderer. This is OvertKill. Literally a ''Mafia-made man''. Nicholas Rocca. Born and raised in Palermo, Sicily. At the age of thirteen, he was extorting protection money from village store owners and selling his already powerful talents as a leg breaker to other youths. At the age of fifteen, he caught the notice of Sicily''s top boss of organized crime, Luciano Bartino, by killing two of Bartino''s best thugs with his bare hands. Instead of having young Rocca killed for his crime, Bartino took Rocca under his wing and began training him to channel his strength and violence for his own use. Nicholas Rocca became known as The Palermo Pit Bull. His body continued to grow as large as his thirst to punish. Bartino took great pleasure in knowing that all of organized crime both envied and feared his hulking hit man. In one of his murderous rampages across the Strait of Messina into Calabria, Rocca killed the son of Vito Calogero. Calogero, a long time rival of Bartino, was enraged. He quickly made plans to kill Rocca. Calling in favors from the oil-rich Arabs that he had helped out on occasion, Calogero had the out-of-town Arabs ambush Rocca. Using over 50 gunmen, the Arabs nearly shred Rocca into hundreds of pieces. He was left for dead. Rocca was found by Bartino''s men and brought home. Through a miracle or the fact that a heart so evil refused to die, Rocca still had a flicker of life left in him. While in Sicily on business with Bartino, Tony Twist, the crime boss of New York, used this moment to seal himself to the debt of Bartino. Twist suggests that Bartino try once more to make a Mafia super hit man like they did once before with the failed Tremor attempt. This time they would have a willing patient in Rocca. They would also use more bionics. Rocca begged Bartino to do it. Revenge now fueled the flames to keep Nicholas Rocca alive. The experiment in the paramesh system went far beyond their expectations. Rocca''s body and mind embraced the operation fully. That night Nicholas Rocca became the name whispered in fear by the Mafia''s enemies - OvertKill! The first order on OvertKill''s menu of manslaughter was the death of Vito Calogero and his crime family. It was done in a flashburn of mayhem. OvertKill''s name became a legend in the circles of organized crime throughout the world. Bartino began using OvertKill as a way of having other members of the organization become indebted to him. He would loan OvertKill''s services out for favors to be named later. One such loan was made to Tony Twist. Twist brought OvertKill to New York to crush Spawn. It was by far the most physical battle that Spawn had ever dealt with in his short time back from the dead. If not for a mechanical oversight with Overt-Kill''s circuits, he would have caused Al Simmons to be the only person to die,twice.','','','','','','','','/pictures2/portraits/10/100/866.jpg');
